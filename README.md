# EEC201 Speaker Recognition
#### Team 42: Henrry Gunawan, Wai Cheong Tsoi

## Introduction
This project builds a system that recognizes the speaker by using mel-frequency cepstrum 
coefficients, vector quantization and k-clustering.

## Completed Milestones
1. Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients
2. Vector Quantization

## Next Steps
1. k-clustering
2. Integrate with GUI
3. Website + Report
